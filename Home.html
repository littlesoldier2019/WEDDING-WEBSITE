         <p class="lovestory-copy">On a rainy 7th of July, the day believed to be the death spirits‚Äô day in Vietnam, Khiem and Ngoc went to a rock bar for different reasons. Khiem simply went there to hang out with his friends. Ngoc, on the other hand, went there because her best friend had been asked by two different men but did not want to be in the club with either of them in front of the other, She convinced Ngoc to accompany her so that she could be with two guys but make it look like a coincidental encounter which occured while she was out with friends. The two girls were wearing brand new dresses taken from Ngoc‚Äôs sister‚Äôs clothing store (without removing price tags :D). The love story started from there.
            <br><br> Days later, Khiem asked Ngoc out for the first date, after which Ngoc spared no chance to schedule several follow-up ones. They went to theaters, they visited food streets, they hung out on the top floor of Ngoc‚Äôs apartment building. Their bonding gradually grew into a romantic relationship without any specific milestones. At some point, they simply started to consider each other partners and proceeded accordingly. <br> <br> As time went by, having faced all the trouble, objections and doubts that a relationship could have, Khiem and Ngoc decided to‚Ä¶ break up. Yes, just like many other couples. For them, however, the breakup helped them realized: They are supposed to be together. They longed to be together, no matter what. Khiem and Ngoc continued to support each other through the worst of days even though they thought their relationship had ended. <br> <br>Now that all the impossibilities, good days and bad days, passionate romance and tragedies have passed and remains only the deep compassion between two individuals with their unique characters and needs: It‚Äôs time to get married. Khiem and Ngoc decided to come together and unite, to continue to learn about each other and to grow as a family. If there is love, there is hope, and there is always a solution. 
            <br> <br> Let‚Äôs join Khiem and Ngoc to celebrate the victory of a faithful love! <3 <3 <3 </p>
